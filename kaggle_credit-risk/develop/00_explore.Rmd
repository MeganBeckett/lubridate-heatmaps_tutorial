The purpose of this notebook is my initial investigation of the problem and the data exploration. 

```{r}
# Load packages 
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Read data
app_train <- read_csv("raw_data/application_train.csv")
app_test <- read_csv("raw_data/application_test.csv")
```
```{r}
# Missing values
missing_val_abs <- colSums(is.na(app_train))
missing_val_per <- missing_val_abs/nrow(app_train)*100
colnames <- colnames(app_train)
missing_summary <- subset(data.frame(missing_val_abs, missing_val_per), missing_val_abs > 0)
missing_summary
```

##### Notes
- There are 67 variables with missing values.

```{r}
# Distribution of classification 
hist(app_train$TARGET)
```
##### Notes
- Binary classification (0 if loan repaid, 1 if loan not repaid).
- There are many more loans paid on time than there aren't.
